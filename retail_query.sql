------ Data Analysis & Findings
--1.Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05:

SELECT *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05';

--2.Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022:

SELECT 
  *
FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    category = 'Clothing'
    AND 
    TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') = '2022-11'
    AND
    quantity >= 4

--3.Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.:
SELECT 
    category,
	sum(total_sale) as net_sale,
	count(*) as total_orders
from retail_sales
group by 1

--4.Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.:
select
category,
round(avg(age),2) as avg_age
from retail_sales
where category='Beauty'
group by 1

--5.Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.:
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE total_sale > 1000

--6.Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.
select
category,
gender,
count(*) as total_trans
from retail_sales
group by category,gender 
order by 1

--7. Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year:

SELECT 
       year,
       month,
    avg_sale
FROM 
(    
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) as year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) as month,
    AVG(total_sale) as avg_sale,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) as rank
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1, 2
) as t1
WHERE rank = 1


---8.Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales **:
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(total_sale) as total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 5


---9.Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.:
SELECT 
    category,    
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as cnt_unique_cs
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY category

--10.Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17):
with hourly_sale
as
(
SELECT *,
    CASE
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
        ELSE 'Evening'
    END as shift
FROM retail_sales
)
select shift,
count(*) as total_sale,
avg(total_sale) as avg_sale
from hourly_sale
group by shift
